## üî¨ About
**SportGym** is a modern fitness application built with **C# and .NET** that empowers users to achieve their fitness goals through personalized workout plans, BMI tracking, and informative content. Designed with a clean and intuitive UI, the app provides a seamless experience for both beginners and experienced gym-goers.

> The goal of SportGym is to support a healthy lifestyle by providing essential tools for self-monitoring, motivation, and continuous improvement.

The visual part of the site comes from a free template. For this, we integrated it into the project through boundles and other methods.
